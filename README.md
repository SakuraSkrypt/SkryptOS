# üå∏ SkryptOS ~ Effortless Performance

This is the official repository for SkryptOS. It provides custom packages, system updates and enhancements while maintaining compatibility.

## üìå Adding SkryptOS to Your System

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements:
- Disable Secure Boot on your bios (easy and safe to do, but may require some googling)
- A USB flash drive 
- Any USB ISO flash tool should work but we recommend (https://www.
- A Computer (obviously)

‚ÄºÔ∏èüö® we only officially offer x86_64 support (modern ""Normal"" computers) at the moment
with hopes to add i386 (should work), arm64 and many others later on" It should still work, but it is completely untested üö®‚ÄºÔ∏è

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install SkryptOS to your System

First things first lets get rid of a few headaches.
almost every system has a bios, dont panic its more scared of you then you are of it.

True i 'could' write an entire signing key for secure boot compatibilty but it is alot of work and theres no real risk in turning it off,
just dont go plugging in random USBs you find on the street, if you have already, you deserve it.

many, but not all, bios have a boot device menu, if you know how to use it, use it.

To ensure that it will work on all systems this is what you should do on even the most stubborn
systems

- Insert the USB flash drive
- Flash the SkryptOS ISO onto the USB flash drive using tool (or dd command if your brave enough) 
- get off Tiktok and take a picture of these instructions on your phone
- restart your computer and enter the bios setup menu
- find the secure boot setting and set it to disabled (Normally in the [Security] menu)
- save and exit
- it will probably prompt to confirm you want secure boot off, (you do)
- if it doesnt restart, restart it
- pat yourself on the back your almost done
- go back into bios, then look for the boot order settings and take another picture of it, then move everything that says USB so it is before 
your hard drive e.g.
    #1 USB FDd
    #2 USB HDD
    #3 Seagate 912GB HDD
- save and exit
- it will now boot into SkryptOS Live
- login with Username: demo Password: demo
- launch the installer on the desktop
- follow instructions
- restart (if the installer doesnt do it) then switch your boot order back to how you like it
- done

Congratulations:
your friends now think your cool and with a little work other people might too
oh and you have the most optimised, powerful, secure, flexible, private and stable OS to currently exist!
